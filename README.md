This is a lightweight project that can be used to keep track of SignalR connections. This is useful in multi-tenant instances where you don't want to broadcast data to other tenants. It hooks into SignalR and allows you to overwrite the default workflow.

## Getting Started

- You must have Visual Studio 2019 Community or higher.
- The dotnet cli is also highly recommended.

## About this project

This project provides a simple interface and a few implementations for that interface. This makes it configurable and easy to setup in the startup of the application. For example, it requires only 1 line of code to swap an in-memory connection tracker with a SQL connection tracker.

## Installation

> ðŸš§ Warning: the packages are not available yet on NuGet.

Use the package manager NuGet to install the base library:

`dotnet add package Dime.WebSockets`

Next it is up to you to decide which _persistence medium_ you want to use:

| Service         | Command                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| In memory cache | `dotnet add package Dime.WebSockets.InMemory` |
| Sql             | `dotnet add package Dime.WebSockets.Sql`      |
| Redis           | `dotnet add package Dime.WebSockets.Redis`    |

## Usage

When a user connects, the connection can be stored in the connection tracker's storage medium. This data can be retrieved when the hub broadcasts data to the clients.

```csharp
public class MyHub : Hub
{
    private readonly IConnectionTracker<Connection> _connectionTracker;

    public MyHub(IConnectionTracker<Connection> connectionTracker)
    {
        _connectionTracker = connectionTracker;
    }

    public override async Task OnConnected()
    {
      await this.ConnectionTracker.AddAsync(new Connection(){ ConnectionId = Context.ConnectionId });
    }
}
```
